Fundamentals of machine learning

In this section, we discuss some of the basic terminologies that are used while working with a machine learning project. It is part of the Machine learning for developers learning path. Supervised versus unsupervised machine learning

Supervised machine learning

Supervised machine learning refers to the type of problems in which each record in the the data set contains a label or a flag.

User: linear algebra
Bot:  Linear algebra

Linear algebra is a field in mathematics that deals with correlations between variables. Understanding the basics of linear algebra goes a long way in helping to understand some of the basics of machine learning. It’s called linear because the output variable can be expressed in terms of the input variables with powers (exponents) not greater than one.
